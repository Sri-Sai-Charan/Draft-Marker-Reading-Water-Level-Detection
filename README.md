## RAFT
This repository contains the source code and paper for RAFT:

[RAFT: Recurrent All Pairs Field Transforms for Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12039.pdf)<br/>
ECCV 2020 <br/>
Zachary Teed and Jia Deng<br/>

## Requirements
The code has been tested with PyTorch 1.6 and Cuda 10.1 as well as with CPU computer.
```Shell
conda create --name raft
conda activate raft
conda install pytorch=1.6.0 torchvision=0.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 matplotlib tensorboard scipy opencv -c pytorch
```

## To Run our Code on the Vessel Movie to detect and mark water levels
If have GPU, run code as is:
```Shell
python main.py
```
if don't have a GPU:
1) Comment out line 20
2) Uncomment line 23
3) Run Code:
```Shell
python main.py
```

CNN Training:
```Shell
python cnn_training.py
```

Final Output video GDrive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S9JEo39-vkEtpP1TtJBmfUNx4ZZ1hCPv?usp=sharing

## Hardware Implementation using Raspberry Pi

```Shell
python3 waterdetection.py
```

Sadly, for the the hardware implemention that due to slow processing onboard the robot with raspberry pi the number detected in the video doesnâ€™t change. Level detection with water especially with flow takes a great deal amount of processing.
